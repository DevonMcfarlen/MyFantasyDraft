## Description <a name="description"></a>
  
My Fantasy Draft uses the ![API-SPORTS NBA API](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba) to search for and provide the average stats for a NBA player for the current season. User's can make use of our search function to find players with good stats, or their favorite players from their favorite teams, and save them into a Fantasy Draft team, which they can quickly look at from their profile page. They can use this to put together the fantasy team of their dreams, or to easily find players for any team ideas they have.
